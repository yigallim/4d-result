### ðŸ“¦ Project Overview

This is a personal project built to **fetch and display 4D lottery results (Damacai, Magnum, Toto)** in a clean, ad-free interface. It scrapes official 4D result websites and shows the latest winning numbers on a lightweight web page.

The primary goal is to help my **grandma**â€”a passionate 4D enthusiastâ€”check her numbers easily without getting overwhelmed by intrusive ads or cluttered layouts. The site updates automatically and is optimized for readability and simplicity.
